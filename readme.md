## Guess The Flag Quiz App-Kotlin (Navigation + Databinding Included)

I was out of the game for almost 1 year and now I have jumped back in to teach myself Kotlin. So, I am excited to share this small project here and also on YouTube. 

This app has. 

1. Navigation Component
2. DataBinding
3. Fragments
4. For loop. 
5. ArrayList
6. Kotlin Object.
